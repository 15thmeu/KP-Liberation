<!--
Add a list of Mods you've checked. This should only contain mods which really affect the feature.
So for a feature like e.g. "hint on entering a sector area" you don't list/test compatibility with RHS, ACE, Achilles, etc.
Also listing CBA isn't necessary, as it's a general dependency in Liberation.
